# Deprecated Arkiv entrypoint

Use the [arkiv router](../arkiv/SKILL.md) for SDK 1.0.0 on Rabdi and the focused task catalog. Install the current router alongside this compatibility entrypoint. Its [capability boundaries](../arkiv/references/known-issues.md) describe the checked APIs and limitations.

If the router is unavailable locally, read the [current canonical router](https://github.com/Arkiv-Network/skills/blob/main/skills/arkiv/SKILL.md) and verify its metadata against the installed SDK before code generation. A source link does not establish the installed or MCP/plugin-bundled revision.

Sources: [SDK 1.0.0 source](https://unpkg.com/@arkiv-network/sdk@1.0.0/src/), [SDK README](https://unpkg.com/@arkiv-network/sdk@1.0.0/README.md). Inspect the installed declarations before adapting executable examples.
