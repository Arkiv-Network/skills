# Content privacy and key custody

Public entities are not a private database. The SDK includes all stored attributes, including bytes columns, in native operation calldata. An access key in the Rabdi URL path protects provider access; it cannot make public network data confidential. Wallet ownership controls eligible mutations, not read confidentiality.

The SDK-independent `arkiv-encryption` API encrypts bytes with AES-256-GCM. Its public symbols include `generateKey`, `importKey`, `encryptPayload` and `decryptPayload`; inspect their installed signatures and consumer guide before integrating. The v1 envelope uses media type `application/vnd.arkiv.encrypted.v1`. The package's 100,000-byte plaintext bound is its own policy, not a universal transaction cap.

Keep an independent encryption key, with private backup and an explicit sharing/recovery policy. A wallet's private key, seed, password or wallet signature is not the input to `importKey`. The package imports exactly 32 raw key bytes or a 64-character hex key without `0x`; it is not a password KDF.

The package encrypts only the supplied bytes. Other column values, owner/creator, entity key, application media type, expiration and ciphertext length remain public. Its envelope has no padding: plaintext length equals envelope length minus 28 bytes. It does not bind an envelope to a particular entity/network/publisher with additional authenticated data, so separately validate that context and do not infer authorship from decryption.

Key loss has no built-in recovery; rotation requires retaining old keys for old ciphertext or publishing newly encrypted data. Losing or revoking a key cannot retract plaintext somebody already decrypted. Expiration/deletion cannot retract previously read copies either. Provider retention of historical data is a separate question; do not infer permanent availability from calldata encoding.

## Equality queries over private values

This is an application design, **not an exported arkiv-encryption feature**. A keyed HMAC blind index can support equality checks while storing the actual value in encrypted bytes columns. Choose normalization, domain separation, field/project/version context and a separate index-key custody policy before implementing it.

Plain unsalted hashes of low-entropy emails or labels can be enumerated. HMAC indexes still reveal equality/frequency and become enumerable if their key is exposed. Do not promise private ranges, prefixes or ordering, and do not copy sensitive values into other cleartext attributes. Index-key rotation changes matching values; plan migration/reconciliation explicitly.

This server-only example uses an independent index key and unambiguous project/version/field framing. The product must choose email normalization; trim/lowercase is only the example's policy. Declare `email_idx` and public `email_kid` as indexed str columns beside the encrypted data, and retain old index keys privately until migration completes.

```typescript
import { createHmac } from "node:crypto"
import { str } from "@arkiv-network/sdk/schema"
import { and, eq, or } from "@arkiv-network/sdk/query"

type IndexKey = { id: string; version: number; secret: Uint8Array }
export function emailIndex(app: string, email: string, slot: IndexKey) {
  if (!app || !slot.id || !Number.isSafeInteger(slot.version) || slot.version < 1 ||
      slot.secret.byteLength < 32) throw new Error("Invalid private index configuration")
  const framed = JSON.stringify([app, slot.version, "email", email.trim().toLowerCase()])
  return str(`0x${createHmac("sha256", slot.secret).update(framed).digest("hex")}`)
}
export function emailLookup(app: string, email: string, retained: readonly IndexKey[]) {
  if (retained.length < 1 || retained.length > 8) throw new Error("Invalid index keyring")
  return or(...retained.map(slot => and(eq("email_kid", str(slot.id)),
    eq("email_idx", emailIndex(app, email, slot)))))
}
```

Keep project/type and trusted-creator scoping outside that OR. Encryptions and blind indexes need separate keys and rotation policies. This index is not authentication, uniqueness, a password hash or protection against equality/linkability leakage; never ship the keyring to the browser.

Access-gating services, wallet-based recovery and encrypted group sharing require their own verified implementation and current service/version checks. They are not provided by the encryption package, and no particular provider version is verified by this skill.

## Retention and publication choice

Rabdi does not offer an expiration-free option. The maximum lifetime measured on 2026-10-30 UTC is 7,884,000 blocks ahead of the current block; maximum-u64 deadlines revert with ExpiryBeyondMaxLifetime. Prefer a published network-parameter getter when available; SDK 1.0.0 has none, so keep the measured bound dated and revalidate after reset/upgrade. Longer-lived ciphertext requires Lifetime Extension before expiry. This live-availability bound does not limit copies already read or guarantee secure erasure.

If a third party must not prolong live query access, do not enable `permissionlessExtension`. Readonly preserves attribute values but still permits eligible extension, transfer or deletion. Decide whether publishing even encrypted metadata is acceptable before writing it.
