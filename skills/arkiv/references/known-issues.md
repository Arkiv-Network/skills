# Versioned capability boundaries

Checked against published SDK 1.0.0 source on 2026-10-30. Source inspection is distinct from a funded or wallet-specific test.

- Queries read current state. The exported API has no historical snapshot, opaque query cursor or historical entity version parameter. Do not present head observations as old block-end state.
- Server ordering and filtered counts are available. A sort takes one key; bytes cannot be sorted. A count includes schema-mismatching matches.
- A schema's default mismatch policy skips rows; an empty returned page does not alone prove traversal completion. Track `skipped` for offsets or fail on mismatch for keyset pagination.
- `watchEntityEvents` starts on its first poll; startup intervals are gaps. A live tail at head works on Rabdi. If the watcher falls more than about 1,000 blocks (~30 min) behind, an older block with logs makes every poll fail; it does not recover on its own. Stop it, recreate the watcher at head and reconcile current state with a query. It cannot backfill or catch up across that gap. Natural Entity Expiration emits no event. See [arkiv#283](https://github.com/Arkiv-Network/arkiv/issues/283).
- Rabdi log behavior verified on 2026-11-02: `eth_getLogs` fails with `-32603 golemdb segment_range_of(transactions): NotImplemented` for blocks with logs about 1,000 blocks behind head; recent blocks work and blocks without logs pass at any age. Do not split or retry the range. The `eth_newFilter` and `eth_getBlockReceipts` methods are unavailable (-32601). Use `arkiv_query` or SDK queries for current state, and per-transaction `eth_getTransactionReceipt` for a known old transaction. See [arkiv#283](https://github.com/Arkiv-Network/arkiv/issues/283).
- A named schema's tag and creator scope do not authenticate mutable content after transfer. See [trust policy](../../arkiv-security-trust/SKILL.md).
- Provider access keys are URL path segments. Missing/non-string keys throw `MissingAccessKeyError`; explicitly empty keys use the heavily limited endpoint. Redact complete transport errors before sharing.
- SDK `createEntity` and `extendEntity` return receipt-derived expiration blocks. A later read failure does not undo a confirmed write. Batches return ordered keys without deadlines; inspect authenticated receipts and read back.
- Library APIs must pass their own installed SDK 1.0 compatibility gate. Never widen peers, downgrade the SDK or invent a release to make examples appear compatible.
